  <jats:p>This article addresses violence against teachers in secondary schools in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. This is assumed to be a complex and multicausal problem that affects the educational process and teachers’ work. From a qualitative phenomenological approach, we recover the voices of a group of teachers who narrate experiences of verbal, physical, symbolic and institutional aggressions in contexts of precariousness, social inequality and impunity. The analysis shows that teachers not only face aggressions from students and their families, but also institutional abandonment, which together make up a school under siege. Tensions are identified between the transforming ideal of the New Mexican School and the concrete conditions of teaching, especially in territories marked by structural violence. The study concludes the need to read violence as a situated and emotional experience that demands responses beyond the punitive or normative to incorporate collective strategies of accompaniment, situated prevention policies and institutional support devices. Finally, the study provides key elements for the design of training, regulatory and educational policy actions that recognize and address the human and territorial dimension of teaching work.</jats:p>

# Escuela sitiada. Violencias contra docentes en Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua

## Abstract

<jats:p>This article addresses violence against teachers in secondary schools in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. This is assumed to be a complex and multicausal problem that affects the educational process and teachers’ work. From a qualitative phenomenological approach, we recover the voices of a group of teachers who narrate experiences of verbal, physical, symbolic and institutional aggressions in contexts of precariousness, social inequality and impunity. The analysis shows that teachers not only face aggressions from students and their families, but also institutional abandonment, which together make up a school under siege. Tensions are identified between the transforming ideal of the New Mexican School and the concrete conditions of teaching, especially in territories marked by structural violence. The study concludes the need to read violence as a situated and emotional experience that demands responses beyond the punitive or normative to incorporate collective strategies of accompaniment, situated prevention policies and institutional support devices. Finally, the study provides key elements for the design of training, regulatory and educational policy actions that recognize and address the human and territorial dimension of teaching work.</jats:p>

# Algorithmic management in occupational risk contexts: balancing privacy and safety in the workplace

## Abstract

<jats:p>Algorithmic management in the workplace has been widely adopted in sectors with high occupational risks due to its potential to mitigate such hazards. However, its use is associated with significant challenges regarding privacy and the protection of workers’ personal data. This article examines the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in employee management within occupational risk contexts, focusing on psychosocial impacts, privacy risks and applicable technical and organizational measures aimed at reconciling data protection with personal safety in these settings. In addition, it presents a case study on the use of geolocation systems in mining environments, highlighting the measures adopted to avoid trade-offs between occupational safety and privacy. The analysis demonstrates that although AI use in this context may reduce labor risks, its application requires strict safeguards to prevent disproportionate impacts on individuals’ privacy. Ultimately, the article discusses concepts and practices aimed at ensuring the responsible use of AI, reconciling technological innovation with fundamental rights in the workplace.</jats:p>

# Core Challenges for Sustainable River Flood Management

## Abstract

<jats:p>River flood management is a complex, multidimensional challenge that requires the integration of technical, social, and regulatory perspectives, among others. This study examines the main challenges in achieving sustainable river flood management and provides a comprehensive framework for addressing them. It explores approaches to mitigate the increasing frequency and severity of river floods, which are worsened by urban expansion and climate change. This study distinguishes river floods from other types, highlighting their specific characteristics and impacts. It presents a timeline of flood management, from traditional levee construction to modern integration in water resources management. Three critical perspectives are included: the Social Component, which stresses the importance of community engagement, equitable risk distribution, and cultural considerations; the Technical Component, which evaluates current technologies such as predictive hydrological models, green infrastructure, and early warning systems; and the Regulatory Component, which reviews existing policies and legal frameworks, noting gaps in international cooperation and enforcement. The paper emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and robust governance. By addressing these core challenges, it offers insights for policymakers, engineers, and stakeholders seeking to mitigate flood risks in a rapidly changing world.</jats:p>

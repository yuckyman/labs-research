Independent spatial checks confirmed these classifications. Off-season greenness, measured as NDVI above 0.50 from July to November, was concentrated near main and secondary canals and decreased with distance from intake points. This workflow combines DTW clustering with rainfall lag and off-season greenness analysis, effectively distinguishing between irrigated and rain-fed regimes using satellite time series.

## Abstract

<jats:p>Mapping of rice-cropping regimes is crucial for effective irrigation planning and yield monitoring, particularly in data-scarce regions. We analyzed 48 months of 3 m PlanetScope NDVI data, aggregated to a 25 m hexagonal grid, and used Dynamic Time Warping Clustering to segment phenological patterns. Internal validation consistently identified two main clusters, indicating two dominant seasonality modes. Cluster 1 exhibited a higher mean NDVI, fewer low-canopy months, more vigorous growth periods, more peaks, and greater annual cycling, which suggests irrigated double cropping. Cluster 2 exhibited prolonged low NDVI values and a greater amplitude, consistent with single-rainfed systems. The rain–NDVI analysis supported these findings: Cluster 1 responded modestly to rainfall, whereas Cluster 2 exhibited a stronger and delayed response. Independent spatial checks confirmed these classifications. Off-season greenness, measured as NDVI above 0.50 from July to November, was concentrated near main and secondary canals and decreased with distance from intake points. This workflow combines DTW clustering with rainfall lag and off-season greenness analysis, effectively distinguishing between irrigated and rain-fed regimes using satellite time series. These findings are considered indicative rather than definitive, providing an assessment of cropping systems in Timor-Leste and demonstrating that DTW-based NDVI clustering offers a scalable approach in data-scarce regions.</jats:p>

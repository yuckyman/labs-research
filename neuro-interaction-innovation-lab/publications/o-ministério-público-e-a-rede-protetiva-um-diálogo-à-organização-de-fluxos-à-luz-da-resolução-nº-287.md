  <jats:p>This article analyzes the role of the Public Prosecutor’s Office as a coordinating agent of the child and adolescent protection network, in light of CNMP Resolution No. 287/2024, which establishes its integrated role in defending children and adolescents who are victims or witnesses of violence. It begins with the historical evolution of the service policy, from philanthropic and protective practices to the establishment of the paradigm of comprehensive protection, based on the 1988 Constitution and the Child and Adolescent Statute. In this context, the text highlights the Public Prosecutor’s Office as a catalyst for institutional coordination among the various actors in the network (health, education, social assistance, public security, and the justice system), reinforcing its constitutional mission and its commitment to resolution, humanization, and social transformation. Finally, institutional dialogue within a network is highlighted as a premise for the implementation of integrated flows and the effectiveness of the Child and Adolescent Rights Guarantee System (SGDCA).</jats:p>

## Abstract

<jats:p>This article analyzes the role of the Public Prosecutor’s Office as a coordinating agent of the child and adolescent protection network, in light of CNMP Resolution No. 287/2024, which establishes its integrated role in defending children and adolescents who are victims or witnesses of violence. It begins with the historical evolution of the service policy, from philanthropic and protective practices to the establishment of the paradigm of comprehensive protection, based on the 1988 Constitution and the Child and Adolescent Statute. In this context, the text highlights the Public Prosecutor’s Office as a catalyst for institutional coordination among the various actors in the network (health, education, social assistance, public security, and the justice system), reinforcing its constitutional mission and its commitment to resolution, humanization, and social transformation. Finally, institutional dialogue within a network is highlighted as a premise for the implementation of integrated flows and the effectiveness of the Child and Adolescent Rights Guarantee System (SGDCA).</jats:p>

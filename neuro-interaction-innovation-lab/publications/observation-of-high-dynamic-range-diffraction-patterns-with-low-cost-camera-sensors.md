# Observation of high dynamic range diffraction patterns with low-cost camera sensors

## Abstract

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Affordable two-dimensional pixelated camera array sensors are now readily available for use in teaching laboratories. The camera sensors typically have a dynamic range of 8-bits (or 256 grey-levels), which is insufficient for observing well-known optical phenomena like Fraunhofer diffraction. While students learn analytical formulation of Fraunhofer diffraction in the classroom, their well-known functional forms cannot be readily verified in the laboratory due to the limited dynamic range of sensor pixels. In this work we demonstrate how one may address the dynamic range problem by using the technique of exposure fusion. Exposure fusion ideas are now already utilized in commercial mobile phone cameras for high dynamic range (HDR) photography in combination with color tone management for visually pleasing image display. Our goal is to demonstrate that the use of exposure fusion in laboratory teaching can allow students to record quantitatively accurate diffraction patterns with an enhanced dynamic range corresponding to 10-11 bits using an 8-bit camera sensor. The methodology described here is suitable for setting up a teaching laboratory experiment for advanced undergraduate or Masters level students.</jats:p>

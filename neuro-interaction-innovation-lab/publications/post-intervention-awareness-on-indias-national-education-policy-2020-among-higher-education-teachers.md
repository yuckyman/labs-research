  <jats:p>The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 in India aimed at substantial educational reforms and the promotion of indigenous knowledge systems. This study focused on evaluating the post-intervention awareness of higher education institution teachers regarding the vision of NEP 2020. Three online sessions of 90 minutes each on 'Higher Education and NEP 2020' were conducted in January 2025 as an intervention. A questionnaire with 20 items was developed to gauge awareness, and a quasi-experimental design with a final sample size of 197 higher education teachers from different universities and colleges was employed. Data was found symmetrical. Data revealed majority of the teachers were having average awareness, while highly aware teachers are in lower proportion. Notably, the female teachers exhibited greater awareness than their male counterparts, suggesting a gender disparity. Additionally, the university teachers demonstrated higher awareness levels than the college teachers, with a statistically non-significant mean difference. These findings contribute valuable insights into the ongoing discourse on the implementation and impact of educational policies in India, highlighting a trend towards a new era of more informed and empowered female teachers in higher education.</jats:p>

# Post-Intervention Awareness on India's National Education Policy 2020 Among Higher Education Teachers: A Case Study Among Some Teachers of HEIs

## Abstract

<jats:p>The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 in India aimed at substantial educational reforms and the promotion of indigenous knowledge systems. This study focused on evaluating the post-intervention awareness of higher education institution teachers regarding the vision of NEP 2020. Three online sessions of 90 minutes each on 'Higher Education and NEP 2020' were conducted in January 2025 as an intervention. A questionnaire with 20 items was developed to gauge awareness, and a quasi-experimental design with a final sample size of 197 higher education teachers from different universities and colleges was employed. Data was found symmetrical. Data revealed majority of the teachers were having average awareness, while highly aware teachers are in lower proportion. Notably, the female teachers exhibited greater awareness than their male counterparts, suggesting a gender disparity. Additionally, the university teachers demonstrated higher awareness levels than the college teachers, with a statistically non-significant mean difference. These findings contribute valuable insights into the ongoing discourse on the implementation and impact of educational policies in India, highlighting a trend towards a new era of more informed and empowered female teachers in higher education.</jats:p>

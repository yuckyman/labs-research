  <jats:p>In this article, I address the fragmented and often siloed understanding of value, value creation, and innovation that pervades both academic literature and business practice. My primary objective is to synthesize a comprehensive theoretical framework that integrates the economic, technological, cultural, and behavioral dimensions of how value is created and perceived in products. My core contribution is a unified model that connects a “Holistic Value Construct” - which maps the domains of value from tangible to intangible - with dual, interconnected innovation paths: a “Technological Innovation Path” focused on production and a “Cultural Innovation Path” centered on the construction of meaning. This framework reveals that sustainable competitive advantage lies in mastering the interplay between these two fundamental forces. I conclude by highlighting the profound implications of this integrated perspective for business strategy, product development, and the direction of future academic research.</jats:p>

# A Unified Theory of Value and Innovation: Integrating Technological Production and Cultural Construction

## Abstract

<jats:p>In this article, I address the fragmented and often siloed understanding of value, value creation, and innovation that pervades both academic literature and business practice. My primary objective is to synthesize a comprehensive theoretical framework that integrates the economic, technological, cultural, and behavioral dimensions of how value is created and perceived in products. My core contribution is a unified model that connects a “Holistic Value Construct” - which maps the domains of value from tangible to intangible - with dual, interconnected innovation paths: a “Technological Innovation Path” focused on production and a “Cultural Innovation Path” centered on the construction of meaning. This framework reveals that sustainable competitive advantage lies in mastering the interplay between these two fundamental forces. I conclude by highlighting the profound implications of this integrated perspective for business strategy, product development, and the direction of future academic research.</jats:p>

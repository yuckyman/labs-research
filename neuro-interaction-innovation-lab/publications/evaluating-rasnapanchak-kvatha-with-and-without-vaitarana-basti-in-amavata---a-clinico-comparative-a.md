  <jats:p>Purpose: The management of Amavata presents significant challenges for physicians due to its chronic and incurable nature, associated complications, and morbidity, which are comparable to those of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Ayurveda offers a range of treatment options for this condition, as documented in classical texts, a detailed examination and comparison of the efficacy of specific Ayurvedic management approaches for patients with rheumatoid arthritis are required. The objective is to identify safe, effective, affordable, and easily accessible solutions that can make a tangible difference in the lives of those affected by this debilitating condition.
  Methodology: The clinical study was conducted into two different groups of 30 patients, by non-random convenience sampling among those who have fulfilled the inclusion criteria and enrolled from the OPD &amp; IPD of department of Kayachikitsa, IPGAER at SVSP Hospital. Study time period was 45 days for individual. Group A - 30 patients were treated with Vaitarana Basti for 15 days schedule (Karma Basti) followed by Rasnapanchak Kvatha 40 ml twice daily for 30 days; Group B - 30 Patients of Amavata were treated only by Rasnapanchak Kvatha - 50ml twice in empty stomach with lukewarm water for 45 days. Results: Overall effect of trial suggests that Group A is highly effective for acute conditions in patients who were capable of holding the Basti for longer period. In Group B the therapy response to chronic case in older patients was better than in Group A. Therapy response was observed after 1 month which showcasing the slow acting, versatile and broad applicability of Group B Intervention.
  Discussion: The study concludes that, both groups of treatment were effective in their specific modalities and the study findings underscores the importance of early intervention as well as highlight the limitations of the treatment for advanced or long-standing cases.</jats:p>

## Abstract

<jats:p>Purpose: The management of Amavata presents significant challenges for physicians due to its chronic and incurable nature, associated complications, and morbidity, which are comparable to those of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Ayurveda offers a range of treatment options for this condition, as documented in classical texts, a detailed examination and comparison of the efficacy of specific Ayurvedic management approaches for patients with rheumatoid arthritis are required. The objective is to identify safe, effective, affordable, and easily accessible solutions that can make a tangible difference in the lives of those affected by this debilitating condition.
Methodology: The clinical study was conducted into two different groups of 30 patients, by non-random convenience sampling among those who have fulfilled the inclusion criteria and enrolled from the OPD &amp; IPD of department of Kayachikitsa, IPGAER at SVSP Hospital. Study time period was 45 days for individual. Group A - 30 patients were treated with Vaitarana Basti for 15 days schedule (Karma Basti) followed by Rasnapanchak Kvatha 40 ml twice daily for 30 days; Group B - 30 Patients of Amavata were treated only by Rasnapanchak Kvatha - 50ml twice in empty stomach with lukewarm water for 45 days. Results: Overall effect of trial suggests that Group A is highly effective for acute conditions in patients who were capable of holding the Basti for longer period. In Group B the therapy response to chronic case in older patients was better than in Group A. Therapy response was observed after 1 month which showcasing the slow acting, versatile and broad applicability of Group B Intervention.
Discussion: The study concludes that, both groups of treatment were effective in their specific modalities and the study findings underscores the importance of early intervention as well as highlight the limitations of the treatment for advanced or long-standing cases.</jats:p>

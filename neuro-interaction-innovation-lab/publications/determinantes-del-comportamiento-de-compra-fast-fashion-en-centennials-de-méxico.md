Through an electronic survey of 331 centennials, a structural equation model based on covariances was developed. Variables such as low price, influencer marketing, sustainable marketing, perceived behavioral control, hedonic motivations, and subjective norm were identified as the main factors explaining fastfashion purchasing behavior.

# AI Literacy and the AI Act in Context: Exploring the 5Ws and 1H

## Abstract

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are ever more embedded in our daily lives, shaping the way we learn, work, communicate, and access both public and private products and services. The integration of AI in information and communication technology is perceived as holding the potential to automate tasks and deal with information in a way that exceeds human capacity. However, the disruptive and pervasive deployment of AI systems in our society can profoundly influence the rule of law, democracy and the realization of human rights. In many situations, interacting with AI systems is no longer an individual choice, but rather a mandatory gateway to essential services such as education, social benefits or border control. Knowing, understanding, and having adequate skills to critically assess and use AI systems is, therefore, not only a personal, but a civic necessity. Recognizing this societal imperative, the AI Act  explicitly acknowledges the importance of equipping citizens with the knowledge, understanding and skills to engage with AI systems in their daily lives and define clear obligations for providers and deployers of AI systems in its Article 4. In this chapter, we  explore AI literacy as it is framed within the regulation, identify possible gaps and propose recommendations.[Preprint chapter for an upcoming book organized by the KU Leuven Centre for IT &amp;amp; IP Law (CiTiP)]</p>

# Sustainable synthesis of value-added compounds from carbohydrates and carbohydrate-based platform molecules

## Abstract

<jats:p>One of the greatest challenges that industry faces in the 21st century is the transition from an economy based on fossil resources to one based on renewable resources. Biomass, which is widespread, abundant and inexpensive, is regarded as an ideal substitute for fossil resources. As a result, it is of great importance to look for efficient approaches to utilize biomass-derived carbohydrates as raw materials to produce value-added products. This chapter highlights selected examples of the most relevant value-added compounds, including furan derivatives, biofuels, amines, and bioplastics, obtained from biomass-derived carbohydrates.</jats:p>

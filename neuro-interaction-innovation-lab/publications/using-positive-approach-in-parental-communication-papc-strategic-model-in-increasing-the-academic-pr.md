  <jats:p>This action research aimed to increase the academic proficiency level of Balik-Aral Senior High School learners at Tarlac National High School for the First Semester of S.Y. 2019-2020 through the Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model which was a new technique designed by the researcher to establish a strong rapport between the parent and the teacher through providing positive feedbacks to the parents about their child that would eventually lead to the learner’s good academic standing. The traditional parental communication method and the Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model were employed to 10 Grade 11 Balik-Aral learners who finished at least the first grading period in the previous year before they dropped out.
  Using the quasi-experimental design, this study evaluated the effectiveness of a treatment which was the traditional parental communication for the controlled group, and the Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model for the experimental group in order to determine if there was a significant difference in the academic proficiency level of the control group before and after the use of the traditional parental communication method, and the experimental group before and after the use of Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model, and if there was a significant imp``rovement in the academic proficiency level of the experimental group after the use of Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model.
  After analyzing the data, this study found out that both traditional parental communication method and the Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model increased the academic proficiency level of the Balik-Aral learners. However, Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model achieved a higher mean than the traditional parental communication method in terms of its effectiveness. Thus, giving positive feedbacks to the parents was more effective than reporting negative issues and concerns about their child’s academic standing. Therefore, it was recommended to establish policies and programs that would strengthen the involvement of parents for the academic proficiency of the learners.</jats:p>

# Using Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model in Increasing the Academic Proficiency Level of  Balik-Aral Senior High School Students

## Abstract

<jats:p>This action research aimed to increase the academic proficiency level of Balik-Aral Senior High School learners at Tarlac National High School for the First Semester of S.Y. 2019-2020 through the Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model which was a new technique designed by the researcher to establish a strong rapport between the parent and the teacher through providing positive feedbacks to the parents about their child that would eventually lead to the learner’s good academic standing. The traditional parental communication method and the Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model were employed to 10 Grade 11 Balik-Aral learners who finished at least the first grading period in the previous year before they dropped out.
Using the quasi-experimental design, this study evaluated the effectiveness of a treatment which was the traditional parental communication for the controlled group, and the Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model for the experimental group in order to determine if there was a significant difference in the academic proficiency level of the control group before and after the use of the traditional parental communication method, and the experimental group before and after the use of Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model, and if there was a significant imp``rovement in the academic proficiency level of the experimental group after the use of Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model.
After analyzing the data, this study found out that both traditional parental communication method and the Positive Approach in Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model increased the academic proficiency level of the Balik-Aral learners. However, Parental Communication (PAPC) Strategic Model achieved a higher mean than the traditional parental communication method in terms of its effectiveness. Thus, giving positive feedbacks to the parents was more effective than reporting negative issues and concerns about their child’s academic standing. Therefore, it was recommended to establish policies and programs that would strengthen the involvement of parents for the academic proficiency of the learners.</jats:p>

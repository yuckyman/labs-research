## Abstract

<jats:p>We explore quantum transport in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) ring threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm flux, incorporating a quasiperiodic site potential based on a generalized cosine modulation with both primary and secondary components. Focusing on spinful, non-interacting electrons, we analyze persistent current behavior across a broad range of filling factors, Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) phase shifts, and hopping dimerizations. Our results uncover a rich interplay of localization-delocalization transitions, driven by the secondary modulation strength, leading to highly tunable and non-monotonic transport signatures. Persistent current is markedly enhanced near the symmetric hopping regime, where quantum interference dominates. In spin-imbalanced configurations, we identify regimes exhibiting pure spin current without net charge flow, suggesting potential for dissipationless spintronic functionalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to examine quantum transport in such a flux-threaded SSH ring with dual-component quasiperiodic modulations, unifying re-entrant localization, spin-current generation, current stabilization, and phase-selective control. The inverse and normalized participation ratios, together with the state-resolved current, reveal the interplay between eigenstate localization and transport, providing insight into the microscopic mechanisms underlying current suppression and enhancement. For completeness, we also present the system-size dependence of the current. These findings position the quasiperiodic SSH ring as a versatile platform for realizing controllable quantum interference and spin-resolved transport in low-dimensional systems.</jats:p>

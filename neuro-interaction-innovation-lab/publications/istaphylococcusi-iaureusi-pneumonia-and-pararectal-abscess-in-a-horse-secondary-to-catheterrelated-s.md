                    septic jugular thrombophlebitis, pneumonia and a delayed‐onset pararectal abscess secondary to bacterial embolization from intravenous catheterization in a horse and demonstrates the successful treatment of all aspects. A racing Arabian mare was presented with an acute onset of fever, tachycardia and tachypnoea following a history of exertional rhabdomyolysis. The mare was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia and a left jugular vein septic thrombophlebitis, with abscess formation at the catheter site. Culture of both transtracheal wash and aspirate of the thrombus yielded heavy growth of a methicillin‐sensitive

                    with congruent sensitivity patterns. The mare was treated successfully and discharged, but subsequently developed a pararectal abscess. Culture of the abscess yielded methicillin‐sensitive

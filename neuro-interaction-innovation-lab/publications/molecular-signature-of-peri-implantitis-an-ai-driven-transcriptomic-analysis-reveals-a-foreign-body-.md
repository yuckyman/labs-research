## Abstract

<jats:p>Peri-implantitis (PI) is a highly destructive inflammatory disease characterized by progressive  bone loss surrounding dental implants. Although it shares clinical features with chronic  periodontitis (CP), its aggressive and often refractory nature suggests a distinct  pathophysiology. This study employs an AI-driven transcriptomic approach using publicly  available human gingival gene expression data (GEO accession: GSE106090¹) to delineate the  molecular mechanisms that distinguish PI from CP. Differential expression analysis identified  approximately 240 significantly deregulated genes (|log₂FC| &amp;gt; 1, p &amp;lt; 0.05) between PI and CP.  The PI transcriptome was dominated by genes associated with inflammation and tissue  destruction — notably IL1B, TNF, MMP9, CXCL8, and SPP1 — while structural and  reparative genes such as COL1A1 and BMP2 were markedly downregulated. Pathway  enrichment analysis revealed strong activation of Cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, NF κB signaling, and Osteoclast differentiation pathways, indicating a hyper-inflammatory, bone resorptive phenotype. Unsupervised Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection  (UMAP) analysis confirmed two distinct molecular clusters separating PI from CP, validating  their transcriptomic divergence. Furthermore, an L1-regularized logistic regression (LASSO)  model identified a compact seven-gene biomarker panel that classified PI and CP with high  accuracy (AUC ≈ 0.90). Collectively, these findings provide the first AI-based molecular  evidence that peri-implantitis represents a foreign-body–driven inflammatory disorder distinct  from classic periodontitis. This work establishes a reproducible molecular map that may serve  as a foundation for precision diagnostics and targeted therapeutics in implant dentistry.</jats:p>

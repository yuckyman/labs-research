# Perspectives on the future of the profession of microbiology.

## Abstract

The Profession of Microbiology (POM) embodies the bulk of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) members and represents the career preparation arm of the ASM for academia, industry, and clinical lab professions. The ASM Council on Microbial Sciences hosted a virtual retreat in 2025 to identify the future of the POM. The retreat presentations centered on workforce development, professional development, innovations in technology, and interdisciplinary collaborations. Various aspects were identified, such as the need to prepare for careers in industry, as an important goal of future training. It was also clear that scientists, in all walks of life, need professional development training throughout their careers, from early trainees to senior scientists. Innovations in technology warrant continual training to keep abreast of global issues. Finally, the need for science advocacy and the ability to effectively communicate science to citizens is important. The ASM is best suited to leading the way in the recruitment of young scientists to the field of microbiology and providing the necessary training to keep them ahead of the changing technologies. As such, the ASM is poised to prepare its members for a quickly changing career workplace, one that will require collaboration between the many sciences and the community.

# Risk of Cardiovascular Disease among Women with PCOS

## Abstract

<jats:p>Insulin resistance is a common feature in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
(PCOS), affecting both obese and lean women, and is associated with an elevated risk
of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). The relationship between PCOS and CVD risk
factors is multifaceted, involving dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, obesity, and
hypertension. Obesity exacerbates the metabolic disturbances in PCOS. Hypertension
is more prevalent in women with PCOS, driven by factors like autonomic nervous
system imbalance and decreased nitric oxide synthesis. Metabolic syndrome is notably
more common in women with PCOS, with insulin resistance being a central factor.
Subclinical CVD manifestations in PCOS include increased inflammatory and
endothelial activation markers and impaired Flow-mediated Dilation (FMD). Early
identification and management of these risk factors are crucial for preventing and
mitigating CVD in women with PCOS.</jats:p>

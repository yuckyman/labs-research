# Neuro-Interaction Innovation Lab

## Overview

**Institution:** Kennesaw State University  
**Location:** Kennesaw, Georgia, USA  
**Director:** Dr. Sylvia Bhattacharya
**Established:** Fall 2019

## Description

The Neuro-Interaction Innovation Lab (NIIL) was founded in Fall 2019 at Kennesaw State University under the direction of Dr. Sylvia Bhattacharya. The lab champions diversity as an integral part of its research team, working on multidisciplinary research projects with a diverse group of students. The lab includes several undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral researchers.

The lab's research focuses on enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) models by examining human intuitive decision-making in complex scenarios. Since joining KSU in 2019, Dr. Bhattacharya has secured over $1 million in funding from the U.S. Army to study driver and passenger behaviors in combat zones, aiming to improve AI algorithms for battlefield decision-making.

The lab highly encourages collaboration with other labs within Kennesaw State University (KSU) as well as outside KSU. Every researcher in this lab is given the independence to work on an area that interests them and share their ideas, thoughts, and strategies with the team.

**Lab Motto:** "Never stop Neuro-vating." A play on the word innovating and the prefix neuro-, the lab challenges itself to neurovate new ways of thinking in the biomedical engineering field.

# Labs Research Tracker

A comprehensive tracking system for research laboratories, faculty members, and publications in computational neuroscience and cognitive science.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized knowledge base for tracking:
- Research laboratories and their focus areas
- Faculty members and their research interests
- Publications and academic output
- Emerging research trends and collaborations

## Structure

### Lab Directories
Each lab has its own directory containing:
- `lab.md` - Laboratory overview and contact information
- `faculty.md` - Faculty roster with research profiles
- `publications.md` - Publication tracking table

### Tracking
The `tracking/` directory contains:
- Research trend observations
- Cross-lab collaboration notes
- Literature review summaries

## Current Labs

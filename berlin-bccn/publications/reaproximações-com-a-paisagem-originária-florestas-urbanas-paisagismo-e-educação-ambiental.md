  <jats:p>The degradation of ecosystems causes numerous environmental problems. In this context, the Atlantic Forest biome has been severely affected throughout our history, with only 0.38% of the original coverage remaining in the city of Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul. Recognizing the benefits that living in treed environments brings to populations and the fact that the restoration of natural environments improves quality of life, this work aimed to promote environmental education with the planting of native trees in a school context. Thus, planting actions were carried out on the campus of the Instituto Federal Farroupilha in Santa Rosa, with tree species native to the southern region of Brazil. The actions took place between 2018 and 2024. The activities were carried out in previously demarcated sectors and consisted of isolated tree plantings and the implementation of a mini-forest. Various members of the school community participated, with an emphasis on student involvement in the practical events. Currently, the number of native species in the intervention sectors has more than tripled, and an improvement in the environmental and landscape quality of the place has been identified. This work demonstrated how concentrated effort, even on a local scale, makes it possible to expand knowledge and visibility of original ecosystems.

# Reaproximações com a paisagem originária: florestas urbanas, paisagismo e educação ambiental

## Abstract

<jats:p>The degradation of ecosystems causes numerous environmental problems. In this context, the Atlantic Forest biome has been severely affected throughout our history, with only 0.38% of the original coverage remaining in the city of Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul. Recognizing the benefits that living in treed environments brings to populations and the fact that the restoration of natural environments improves quality of life, this work aimed to promote environmental education with the planting of native trees in a school context. Thus, planting actions were carried out on the campus of the Instituto Federal Farroupilha in Santa Rosa, with tree species native to the southern region of Brazil. The actions took place between 2018 and 2024. The activities were carried out in previously demarcated sectors and consisted of isolated tree plantings and the implementation of a mini-forest. Various members of the school community participated, with an emphasis on student involvement in the practical events. Currently, the number of native species in the intervention sectors has more than tripled, and an improvement in the environmental and landscape quality of the place has been identified. This work demonstrated how concentrated effort, even on a local scale, makes it possible to expand knowledge and visibility of original ecosystems.

  <jats:p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)-supported tools designed for learning are highly integrated into adult learning programs.

Additionally, 50 percent highlighted the need for greater involvement of the tutor. Overall, the results indicate mixed yet generally positive perceptions among adult learners toward AI-supported tools, aligning with existing research. Thus, this study addresses a knowledge gap by examining adult learners’ perceptions of AI-supported learning tools, underscoring the importance of adopting these tools alongside ethical safeguards, individual support, and clear communication.

# Adult Learners’ Perceptions of AI-Supported Learning Tools: A Secondary Data Analysis of Recent Literature

## Abstract

<jats:p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)-supported tools designed for learning are highly integrated into adult learning programs. Nonetheless, research on adult learners’ perspectives, particularly regarding self-efficacy, motivation, ethical issues, and usefulness, remains scarce and limited. This study conducts a secondary data analysis of 12 current peer-reviewed articles published between 2018 and 2025. A simple qualitative research framework is employed to categorise common themes reported across the selected studies. The articles are reviewed and categorized into key themes, including motivation and engagement, perceived efficiency, personalisation, and ethical concerns. The findings show that approximately 83 percent of the studies reported positive adult learners’ perspectives of AI-supported tools, and 75 percent indicated increased engagement or motivation. Improvement in the effectiveness of learning was reported at 60 percent. Nonetheless, about 58 percent identified issues linked to algorithmic bias and transparency. Additionally, 50 percent highlighted the need for greater involvement of the tutor. Overall, the results indicate mixed yet generally positive perceptions among adult learners toward AI-supported tools, aligning with existing research. Thus, this study addresses a knowledge gap by examining adult learners’ perceptions of AI-supported learning tools, underscoring the importance of adopting these tools alongside ethical safeguards, individual support, and clear communication.

# Restoration legacy, forest cover and elevation shape frugivory in a tropical landscape

## Abstract

<jats:p>Assisted and passive natural restoration are widely applied strategies for forest restoration, yet their focus on tree recovery makes their effectiveness in restoring broader biodiversity unclear. Assuming that tree recruitment will rebuild whole ecosystems overlooks other taxa and their interactions, and thus underestimates key components of biodiversity like biotic interactions. To address this gap, we assessed how frugivory varied across a restored landscape by assessing how assisted and natural regeneration, together with biotic (fruit size and availability), abiotic (elevation and time), and landscape factors (forest cover and fragmentation) shape frugivore interactions with dummy fruits. We observed that fruit attacks were not driven solely by restoration type but also by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. Attack rates were higher at greater elevations and in areas with increased old-growth and secondary forest cover. Fruit size also influenced attack rates, particularly in restoration areas, where larger fruits experienced more attacks. Because secondary forest results from both restoration strategies, its spread appears to have helped frugivory recovery and maintenance across the landscape. Yet small, isolated old‐growth patches remain crucial as reservoirs of frugivore activity. Our findings indicate that forest recovery efforts should look beyond restoration strategies and explicitly consider how biotic traits, abiotic gradients and landscape structure interact to reestablish frugivory and, by extension, broader ecosystem processes.</jats:p>

  <jats:p>Insects and spiders, which are called arthropods, live all around us—even in small meadows, parks, lawns, and gardens. Humans often create meadows by mowing, which keeps them open, grassy, and full of flowers. But did you know that mowing can harm arthropods by destroying their homes and even hurting or killing them? In this article, we show how mowing changes the lives of arthropods and explore ways to make mowing safer for them. For example, people could mow only once or twice a year, use gentler equipment, and leave some parts of the meadow unmown to give arthropods safe spaces to survive. With this article, we aim to inspire people to make choices that keep our meadows full of life and to help stop insect decline.</jats:p>

# The Living Meadow: How Mowing Affects Insects and Spiders

## Abstract

<jats:p>Insects and spiders, which are called arthropods, live all around us—even in small meadows, parks, lawns, and gardens. Humans often create meadows by mowing, which keeps them open, grassy, and full of flowers. But did you know that mowing can harm arthropods by destroying their homes and even hurting or killing them? In this article, we show how mowing changes the lives of arthropods and explore ways to make mowing safer for them. For example, people could mow only once or twice a year, use gentler equipment, and leave some parts of the meadow unmown to give arthropods safe spaces to survive. With this article, we aim to inspire people to make choices that keep our meadows full of life and to help stop insect decline.</jats:p>

Acute vascular cerebellar lesions around the midline and brainstem lesions affecting the vestibular nuclei can clinically mimic acute unilateral vestibulopathy; an MRI becomes clinically relevant after a few days. In unilateral thalamic infarcts, ipsilateral or contralateral tilts of perceived verticality can be differentiated by functional connectivity MRI. Rare cases of cortical rotational vertigo are due to a disconnection of interhemispheric pathways via the corpus callosum. About 30% of patients with vestibular migraine have a mild bilateral endolymphatic hydrops of the inner ear, especially in the vestibulum rather than the cochlea. Classical vestibular paroxysmia is caused by neurovascular cross-compression, which is most reliably detected by vestibular nerve angulation in DTI-MRI.</jats:p>

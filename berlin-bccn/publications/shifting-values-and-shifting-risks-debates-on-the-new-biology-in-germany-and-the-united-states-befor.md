In the 1970s and 1980s, when the new social movements (peace movement, anti-nuclear power movement, ecology movement, feminist movement) started to debate genetic engineering, the public and political controversies about recombinant DNA technologies remained closely intertwined with issues of cloning, embryo research and in-vitro fertilization (IVF).

It demonstrates how different understandings of gene technologies and their future impact on society collided and how different concepts of risk developed among both scientists and the public after Asilomar.

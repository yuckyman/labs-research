                    <jats:p>Demographic ageing and increasing life expectancy require sociology to recognize and address new but also persistent challenges. The sociology of age and ageing is essential for understanding contemporary societies because age is a fundamental marker of social difference that structures roles, rights, responsibilities, and life trajectories. Age profoundly shapes opportunities and constraints, often through ageism, which remains one of the most pervasive forms of discrimination across life stages. Despite its wide relevance, however, sociological research has tended to privilege middle age, often overlooking older adults and failing to integrate age structures into broader theories of inequality and social order. This Special Issue aims to mainstream age into general sociological debates by showcasing what a sociology of age and ageing can contribute to sociological theory building (part 1), methodological developments and empirical insights (part 2). It demonstrates that the sociology of ageing is not a niche field but a vital driver of broader sociological theory, applying perspectives from Marx and Bourdieu to affect theories and care ethics. Importantly, it shows theoretically as well as empirically how age intersects with categories such as gender, race, class, and disability, generating complex configurations of privilege and disadvantage that vary across institutional contexts like employment, healthcare, and political representation. By treating age as a dynamic category of difference, we argue for adding complexity to intersectional analysis to better understand processes of inequality, vulnerability, and care across the life course. Ultimately, the issue calls for dialogue between sociology of ageing and sociology at large, positioning age as a “litmus test” for advancing sociological inquiry.</jats:p>

# Sociology of Age and Ageing: Theoretical and Empirical Challenges (Re‑)Visited

## Abstract

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Demographic ageing and increasing life expectancy require sociology to recognize and address new but also persistent challenges. The sociology of age and ageing is essential for understanding contemporary societies because age is a fundamental marker of social difference that structures roles, rights, responsibilities, and life trajectories. Age profoundly shapes opportunities and constraints, often through ageism, which remains one of the most pervasive forms of discrimination across life stages. Despite its wide relevance, however, sociological research has tended to privilege middle age, often overlooking older adults and failing to integrate age structures into broader theories of inequality and social order. This Special Issue aims to mainstream age into general sociological debates by showcasing what a sociology of age and ageing can contribute to sociological theory building (part 1), methodological developments and empirical insights (part 2). It demonstrates that the sociology of ageing is not a niche field but a vital driver of broader sociological theory, applying perspectives from Marx and Bourdieu to affect theories and care ethics. Importantly, it shows theoretically as well as empirically how age intersects with categories such as gender, race, class, and disability, generating complex configurations of privilege and disadvantage that vary across institutional contexts like employment, healthcare, and political representation. By treating age as a dynamic category of difference, we argue for adding complexity to intersectional analysis to better understand processes of inequality, vulnerability, and care across the life course. Ultimately, the issue calls for dialogue between sociology of ageing and sociology at large, positioning age as a “litmus test” for advancing sociological inquiry.</jats:p>

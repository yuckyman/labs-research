  <jats:p>Background: Animal-assisted interventions (AAI) on college campuses are known to be beneficial for student mental health; however, these benefits are short-term. Owning a pet can produce similar long-term outcomes, yet students living in university-owned housing are often not permitted to own pets.
  Aim: This study explored the association between pet ownership and self-reported emotions of depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness among undergraduate college students.
  Methods: This descriptive, quantitative study used convenience sampling to recruit undergraduate students (n = 391) from a public academic institution in the northern Appalachian region of the United States. Data from anonymous, electronic surveys were analyzed to identify sample characteristics and differences in outcome variables based on pet ownership status.
  Results: Pet ownership was associated with lower levels of self-reported depression, stress, and loneliness. Greater psychological distress and loneliness were reported among students who identified as non-binary, sophomores, and those living in residence halls.
  Conclusions: Findings from this study underscore the importance of ongoing psychological support for undergraduate students and offer meaningful implications for policy change. Academic institutions should consider allowing students to own a pet in university-owned housing as an additional way to support their psychological health and provide companionship when they need it most.</jats:p>

# Associations Between Pet Ownership, Psychological Health, and Loneliness Among Undergraduate College Students

## Abstract

<jats:p>Background: Animal-assisted interventions (AAI) on college campuses are known to be beneficial for student mental health; however, these benefits are short-term. Owning a pet can produce similar long-term outcomes, yet students living in university-owned housing are often not permitted to own pets.
Aim: This study explored the association between pet ownership and self-reported emotions of depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness among undergraduate college students.
Methods: This descriptive, quantitative study used convenience sampling to recruit undergraduate students (n = 391) from a public academic institution in the northern Appalachian region of the United States. Data from anonymous, electronic surveys were analyzed to identify sample characteristics and differences in outcome variables based on pet ownership status.
Results: Pet ownership was associated with lower levels of self-reported depression, stress, and loneliness. Greater psychological distress and loneliness were reported among students who identified as non-binary, sophomores, and those living in residence halls.
Conclusions: Findings from this study underscore the importance of ongoing psychological support for undergraduate students and offer meaningful implications for policy change. Academic institutions should consider allowing students to own a pet in university-owned housing as an additional way to support their psychological health and provide companionship when they need it most.</jats:p>

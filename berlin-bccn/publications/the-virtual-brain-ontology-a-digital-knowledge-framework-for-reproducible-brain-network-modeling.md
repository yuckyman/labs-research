# The Virtual Brain Ontology: A Digital Knowledge Framework for Reproducible Brain Network Modeling

                  Computational models of brain network dynamics offer mechanistic insights into brain function and disease, and are utilized for hypothesis generation, data interpretation, and the creation of personalized digital brain twins. However, results remain difficult to reproduce and compare because equations, parameters, networks, and numerical settings are reported inconsistently across the literature, and shared code is often not fully documented, standardized, or executable. We introduce

                  (TVB-O), a semantic knowledge base, minimal metadata standard, and Python toolbox that simplifies the description, execution, and sharing of network simulations. TVB-O offers 1) a common vocabulary and ontology for core concepts and axioms representing current domain knowledge for simulating brain network dynamics, 2) a minimal, human- and machine-readable metadata specification for the information needed to reproduce an experiment, 3) a curated database of published models, brain networks, and study configurations, and 4) software that generates executable code for various simulation platforms and programming languages, including The Virtual Brain, Jax, or Julia.

By reducing technical barriers and standardizing workflows, TVB-O broadens access to computational neuroscience and establishes a foundation for transparent, shareable “digital brain twins” that integrate with clinical pipelines and large-scale data resources.

  <jats:p>Background: Incorporating scientific evidence into fire management is essential for enhancing resilience to increasing bushfire risk. The New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), steward of ~10% of the state’s land, seeks to embed research into decision-making. Objective: This study identifies organisational barriers and facilitators that shape the uptake of bushfire research within the NPWS. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 12 NPWS staff in planning/operations and two focus groups (knowledge brokers; external researchers). Data were thematically analysed using Knowledge to Action and Diffusion of Innovations. Results: Three themes emerged: (1) System and governance conditions—decentralisation created variability that was reduced by visible leadership signals and lightweight shared decision artefacts (e.g., SOP/decision-brief standards); (2) Knowledge flows and brokerage—ad-hoc, system-fatigued shifted to routine use when a distributed broker network, documented lessons, and fit-for-workflow platforms were in place; and (3) Workforce capability and routines—time pressure and uneven skills constrained uptake, while targeted professional development, mentoring, and protected learning time enabled it. Consistent research use occurred only when these three conditions aligned. Conclusion: Formal research integration roles, mainstreamed professional development, stronger communication platforms, refined funding mechanisms, and visible leadership can foster an evidence-based culture, enhancing NPWS’s capacity to mitigate bushfire risk.</jats:p>

# Bridging the Gap: Integrating Scientific Research into Fire Management Practices for Enhanced Organisational and Environmental Resilience

## Abstract

<jats:p>Background: Incorporating scientific evidence into fire management is essential for enhancing resilience to increasing bushfire risk. The New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), steward of ~10% of the state’s land, seeks to embed research into decision-making. Objective: This study identifies organisational barriers and facilitators that shape the uptake of bushfire research within the NPWS. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 12 NPWS staff in planning/operations and two focus groups (knowledge brokers; external researchers). Data were thematically analysed using Knowledge to Action and Diffusion of Innovations. Results: Three themes emerged: (1) System and governance conditions—decentralisation created variability that was reduced by visible leadership signals and lightweight shared decision artefacts (e.g., SOP/decision-brief standards); (2) Knowledge flows and brokerage—ad-hoc, system-fatigued shifted to routine use when a distributed broker network, documented lessons, and fit-for-workflow platforms were in place; and (3) Workforce capability and routines—time pressure and uneven skills constrained uptake, while targeted professional development, mentoring, and protected learning time enabled it. Consistent research use occurred only when these three conditions aligned. Conclusion: Formal research integration roles, mainstreamed professional development, stronger communication platforms, refined funding mechanisms, and visible leadership can foster an evidence-based culture, enhancing NPWS’s capacity to mitigate bushfire risk.</jats:p>

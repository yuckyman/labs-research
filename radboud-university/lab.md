# Radboud University - Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour

## Overview

**Institution:** Radboud University  
**Research Institute:** Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour  
**Location:** Nijmegen, Netherlands  
**Director:** [To be updated]  
**Established:** 1999

## Description

The Donders Institute is one of Europe's leading neuroscience centers, conducting fundamental, cognitive, and clinical neuroscience research. The institute brings together researchers from multiple disciplines to understand the mechanistic, computational, and dynamic underpinnings of cognition and behavior in health and disease.

The Donders Institute is renowned for its integrative approach, combining neuroimaging (MRI, MEG, EEG), computational modeling, genetics, and clinical research to address fundamental questions about brain function.

- **Lead Researcher:** Floris de Lange
- **Focus:** Neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying predictive processing during perception and decision-making.

### Visual Cognitive Neuroscience Group
- **Lead Researcher:** Marius Peelen
- **Focus:** Neural basis of interactions between visual perception and cognition, exploring how the brain extracts meaningful information from complex scenes and how visual cortex activity interfaces with cognitive functions such as memory and attention.

### Perception and Brain Dynamics Laboratory
- **Lead Researcher:** David Heeger
- **Focus:** Neural mechanisms of visual perception, attention, and working memory, employing computational models to understand cortical circuits.

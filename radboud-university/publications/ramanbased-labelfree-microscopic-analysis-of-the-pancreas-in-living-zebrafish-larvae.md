# Raman‐based label‐free microscopic analysis of the pancreas in living zebrafish larvae

## Abstract

<jats:p>
                    Advanced microscopy techniques, combined with a diverse set of fluorescent probes, provide valuable tools for uncovering insights into biological systems and addressing fundamental research questions. However, the need to develop and use genetic tags and probe markers presents notable challenges. Coherent Raman scattering microscopy offers a label‐free alternative, enabling live‐cell imaging of cellular structures without the need for labeling. Leveraging the benefits of Raman microscopy, we aim to analyze the pancreas in living zebrafish larvae and to evaluate chemical changes in pancreatic exocrine and endocrine compartments following exocrine damage. Here, we present a protocol for Raman‐based label‐free microscopic analysis of the pancreas in living zebrafish larvae. Using forward stimulated Raman scattering (F‐SRS) and epi coherent anti‐Stokes Raman scattering (E‐CARS), zebrafish pancreatic structures were analyzed and validated. Vibrational Raman spectra between 450 and 3100 cm

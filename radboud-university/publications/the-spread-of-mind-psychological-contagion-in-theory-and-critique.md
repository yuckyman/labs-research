  <jats:p>Psychological contagion (PC) involves the transfer and “snowballing” of emotions, perceptions, or behaviors within or across individuals, often through subtle, automatic, or unconscious mechanisms. This narrative review synthesizes cross-disciplinary evidence and proposes a mechanism-level Cascading-Resonance Model of PC. Drawing on neuroscience, social psychology, media studies, and diffusion theory, we identify nine mechanisms that instantiate a three-layer process involving individual resonance, interpersonal synchronization, and group-level cascade.

# The spread of mind: psychological contagion in theory and critique

## Abstract

<jats:p>Psychological contagion (PC) involves the transfer and “snowballing” of emotions, perceptions, or behaviors within or across individuals, often through subtle, automatic, or unconscious mechanisms. This narrative review synthesizes cross-disciplinary evidence and proposes a mechanism-level Cascading-Resonance Model of PC. Drawing on neuroscience, social psychology, media studies, and diffusion theory, we identify nine mechanisms that instantiate a three-layer process involving individual resonance, interpersonal synchronization, and group-level cascade. We summarize empirical patterns across cross-modal domains, map mechanisms to observable indicators and intervention levers, as well as offer falsifiable propositions for measurement and platform-level testing. We further explore the role of contagion in modern-day controversies and anomalous experiences. Findings are preliminary and based on conceptual synthesis rather than exhaustive meta-analysis, so we highlight priority directions for causal, multilevel research and policy evaluation.</jats:p>

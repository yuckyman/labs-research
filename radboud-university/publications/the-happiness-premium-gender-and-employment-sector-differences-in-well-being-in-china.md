For both men and women, higher life satisfaction in the public sector stems primarily from institutional returns rather than compositional differences in individual characteristics.

For both men and women, higher life satisfaction in the public sector stems primarily from institutional returns rather than compositional differences in individual characteristics. Counterfactual analyses further show that private-sector workers would experience greater life satisfaction if employed in the public sector, underscoring the desirability of public employment in China’s labor market.

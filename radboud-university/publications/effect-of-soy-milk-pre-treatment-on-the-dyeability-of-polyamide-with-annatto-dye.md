                      <jats:p>The purpose of this work is to investigate the optimal conditions for dyeing polyamide fabrics using a natural dye extracted from annatto seeds, both with and without pre-treatment of the fibers with soy milk, to evaluate its potential as a plant-based mordant. The study encompassed analyses of color intensity and uniformity, wash and rubbing fastness tests, as well as characterizations through spectrophotometry, SEM and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The research aimed to understand the behavior of the carotenoids bixin and norbixin under different pH ranges, with an emphasis on sustainability and the replacement of metallic mordants with environmentally friendly alternatives.

                      <jats:p>Polyamide fabrics were pre-treated with soy milk and dyed by exhaustion using annatto extract at different pH levels. Analyses included color strength (K/S), color difference (ΔE), washing and rubbing fastness, SEM and FTIR. Soy milk improved color uniformity and intensity, especially at alkaline pH (K/S = 40.30; ΔE = 0.77). It acted as a binder rather than a mordant. The study introduces a sustainable method for dyeing synthetic fibers with natural pigments, replacing metallic mordants with plant-based alternatives.</jats:p>

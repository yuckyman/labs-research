                      <jats:p>Accurate prediction of treatment outcomes is crucial for personalized treatment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Beyond one-year survival, assessing long-term enteral nutrition dependence is essential for optimizing patient counseling and resource allocation. This preliminary study aimed to predict one-year survival and feeding tube dependence in surgically treated HNSCC patients using classical machine learning.</jats:p>

                        Urogenital schistosomiasis remains a major public health challenge among children and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on prevalence and associated factors in Zambia are scarce. This study assessed the burden of

                        We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of clinical records from January to March 2025. Systematic random sampling of files for participants aged 5–18 years captured sociodemographic data, water-contact behaviours, haematuria, haematological indices (haemoglobin, MCV, MCHC), deworming history, and prior schistosomiasis.

                        The median age was 13 years (IQR: 12–15); 58.3% were male. Overall prevalence of schistosomiasis was 25.8% (

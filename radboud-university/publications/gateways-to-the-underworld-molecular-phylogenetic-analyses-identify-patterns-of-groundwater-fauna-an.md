# Gateways to the underworld: molecular phylogenetic analyses identify patterns of groundwater fauna and two new species of hypogean Hyalella Smith, 1874 (Amphipoda, Hyalellidae) from the northern Mojave Desert

## Abstract

<jats:p>
                    In North America, the genus
                    <jats:italic>Hyalella</jats:italic>
                    (Crustacea: Amphipoda) is primarily epigean, with only two described species found in groundwater. In contrast,
                    <jats:italic>Stygobromus</jats:italic>
                    is an amphipod genus occupying subterranean habitats throughout most of the Nearctic. Using both molecular and morphological traits, we describe two new species of stygobitic amphipods,
                    <jats:italic>Hyalella plutonia</jats:italic>
                    <jats:bold>sp. nov.</jats:bold>
                    and
                    <jats:italic>Hyalella keepuikantun</jats:italic>
                    <jats:bold>sp. nov.</jats:bold>
                    from groundwater habitats in Nye County, Nevada, USA. These species form a monophyletic group that also contains the similar
                    <jats:italic>H. cretae</jats:italic>

The description of these species highlights the unexpected diversity of stygobitic

  <jats:p>This study was carried out during 2022–2023 years at the Sultanhisar Vocational School’s application greenhouse to investigate the effects of liquid fertilizer applications with different compositions on plant growth, yield and fruit quality in strawberry varieties. The experiment was set up in randomized complete blocks designs with three replications. For this study, two varietys, cvs. Rubygem and Sabrina were used. Three liquid fertilizers, organo-mineral fertilizers as DNZ (7-7-7) organo-mineral liquid fertilizer, MİKOKS as nanotechnological liquid fertilizer, and Mol as organic fertilizer certified liquid fertilizer were used. The fertilizers were applied to the strawberry plants using the fertigation method at the recommended doses indicated on the labels. In Rubygem and Sabrina varieties, organo-mineral fertilizer increased yield and also increased fruit weight, fruit width, and fruit length. In Rubygem variety, plant fresh and dry weight increased with nanotechnological fertilizer, while in Sabrina variety increased with organo-mineral fertilizer. As a result, strawberry plants fertilized with organomineral fertilizer yielded better results in terms of fruit yield and quality compared to nanotechnological and organic fertilizers.</jats:p>

# Influence of Organic and Organa-mineral Fertilizers on the Yield and Fruit Quality of Strawberries (Fragaria ×ananassa Duch.) under Greenhouse Conditions

## Abstract

<jats:p>This study was carried out during 2022–2023 years at the Sultanhisar Vocational School’s application greenhouse to investigate the effects of liquid fertilizer applications with different compositions on plant growth, yield and fruit quality in strawberry varieties. The experiment was set up in randomized complete blocks designs with three replications. For this study, two varietys, cvs. Rubygem and Sabrina were used. Three liquid fertilizers, organo-mineral fertilizers as DNZ (7-7-7) organo-mineral liquid fertilizer, MİKOKS as nanotechnological liquid fertilizer, and Mol as organic fertilizer certified liquid fertilizer were used. The fertilizers were applied to the strawberry plants using the fertigation method at the recommended doses indicated on the labels. In Rubygem and Sabrina varieties, organo-mineral fertilizer increased yield and also increased fruit weight, fruit width, and fruit length. In Rubygem variety, plant fresh and dry weight increased with nanotechnological fertilizer, while in Sabrina variety increased with organo-mineral fertilizer. As a result, strawberry plants fertilized with organomineral fertilizer yielded better results in terms of fruit yield and quality compared to nanotechnological and organic fertilizers.</jats:p>

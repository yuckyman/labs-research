# EP Additives with Enhanced Sustainability for Water-miscible Metalworking Fluids

## Abstract

<ti:p>Extreme pressure additives are essential components for many water-borne metalworking fluids. They are used to prevent adhesive wear and cold welding by generating protective layers on metal surfaces under boundary lubrication conditions in heavy duty cutting and forming processes. Sulfur carriers are high-performing EP-additives that can support the metalworking industry on their way to a more sustainable future.</ti:p>

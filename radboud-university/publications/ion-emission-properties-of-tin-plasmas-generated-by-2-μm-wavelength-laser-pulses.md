# Ion emission properties of tin plasmas generated by 2  μm-wavelength laser pulses

## Abstract

<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
                  <jats:p>Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of ion emission from a plasma generated by irradiating tin droplets with $\lambda_{\mathrm{laser}} = 2$ \textmu m-wavelength laser light. Two cases are considered: first a `short pulse' (27 ns-long) case with laser intensity $I_{\mathrm{laser}} \sim 10^{11}$ W cm$^{-2}$ that can be readily benchmarked with present experimental systems. Then, a `long pulse' case is studied, in which the droplet is irradiated until it is fully vaporized, which takes $ \sim 150$ ns. The kinetic energy-resolved ion spectra in both cases feature a high-energy peak on the order of keVs. At lower kinetic energies the spectra are substantially different: the short pulse spectrum exhibits much higher ion numbers due to plasma cooling at the end of the pulse, which is not present in the long-pulse case. % The difference between the spectra is attributed to whether the laser-induced, high-temperature region vanishes or is present until vaporization. &amp;#xD;The following quantities of interest are analyzed: angle-dependence of peak kinetic energy, total kinetic energy, and total ion number, as well as intensity-dependence of the kinetic energy peak. To provide a measure of non-fluid behaviour, we calculate the local Knudsen number; though the obtained values are significant, the kinetic energy data are found to be reliable, and can be extrapolated to larger distances.</jats:p>
